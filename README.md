This project is an attempt to automate the process of doing my physics homework. The goal (at least for now) is to find all the relavent kinematic parameters of a scenario, given the minimum neccesary number of base parametrs, for any two dimensional single-object constant acceleration problem. Ideally, I will add the capacity to deal with things like mass, momentum, more than one object, more tha two dimensions, etc.
